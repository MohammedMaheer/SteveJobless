# Virtual Pet Study Buddy

## Overview
**Virtual Pet Study Buddy** is a platform designed to help users connect with random strangers to study together, all while maintaining a calming and productive environment. The platform focuses on a minimalist, aesthetic-driven interface that enhances productivity and user experience. Although currently a UI-only project, the app offers a variety of features to create an engaging study session.

## Features
- **Minimalist Study Dashboard**: A clean and straightforward dashboard that includes a timer, music player, and session details for a distraction-free environment.
- **Virtual Pet Animation**: A virtual plant or pet that grows or wilts based on the user's focus and productivity levels, providing gentle motivation to stay on track.
- **Customizable Themes**: Calming background themes that can be customized by users to match their aesthetic preferences, enhancing the study experience.
- **Progress Visualization**: A focus meter or progress bar to visualize study sessions and track productivity in real-time.
- **Distraction Tracker**: A subtle distraction tracker that monitors user focus. Distractions trigger small, non-intrusive notifications and affect the virtual plant’s or pet's health.
- **Optional Interaction**: Light interaction options like video or chat are available, allowing users to communicate with their study partners without detracting from the focus.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: Study session reminders and notifications are delivered in a sleek, non-intrusive manner to maintain focus.

## Technologies Used

## UI Features (from screenshot)

  - **Play**: Allows for small study breaks.
